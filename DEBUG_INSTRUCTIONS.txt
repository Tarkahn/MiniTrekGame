DEBUG LOG SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

The game now has a debug logging system that captures all troubleshooting output to a file.

HOW TO USE:
1. Run the game normally: python main.py
2. Navigate to star systems with planets (look for star+planet systems in the event log)
3. The game will automatically scan each system and show results in the event log
4. When you exit the game, look for a file named "debug_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt" in the game directory
5. Share this debug log file so we can see exactly what's happening with enemy generation

WHAT THE DEBUG LOG CONTAINS:
- Enemy placement calculations during galaxy generation
- System object generation details
- Auto-scan results for each system you visit
- Detailed information about why enemies are or aren't appearing

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- When you visit a STAR+PLANET system, the event log should show:
  [SYSTEM TYPE] STAR+PLANET
  [DEBUG] Expected enemies from placement: X (where X > 0 for some systems)
  [ENEMIES] X enemy ships detected (or "No enemy ships in this system")

If you see "Expected enemies but none found!" then the debug log will help identify where in the pipeline the enemies are being lost.

DELETE THE LOG FILE after each test to get a fresh log for the next test run.
