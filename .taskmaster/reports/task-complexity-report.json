			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into creating the Git repository and establishing the folder structure.",
			"reasoning": "The task is straightforward but can benefit from separating the repository initialization from the folder structure setup for clarity."

			"taskTitle": "Define Constants in constants.py",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Document each constant with comments explaining its purpose and usage.",
			"reasoning": "While defining constants is simple, ensuring proper documentation adds a layer of complexity that should be addressed."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Base Ship Class",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the definition of attributes, methods for damage handling, and methods for energy allocation into distinct subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves multiple components of OOP, making it beneficial to break it down for better focus and testing."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Player and Enemy Ship Classes",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing player-specific methods, enemy AI behavior, and integrating with the BaseShip class.",
			"reasoning": "This task is complex due to the need for interaction between classes and the implementation of distinct behaviors."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Ship Systems Classes",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the creation of each ship system class (phasers, shields, torpedoes, sensors) into individual subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Each system has unique functionality and requires separate attention, making it beneficial to handle them as distinct tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Navigation and Movement Logic",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation into local sector movement, warp travel logic, and energy consumption management.",
			"reasoning": "The navigation mechanics involve multiple complex interactions that warrant separate subtasks for clarity and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Combat Mechanics",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for damage application, shield absorption logic, and critical hit implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Combat mechanics are inherently complex and involve multiple calculations that should be handled separately for thorough testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Scanning Mechanics",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the implementation of short-range and long-range scanning functionalities into distinct subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "While the task is manageable, separating the scanning types allows for focused development and testing."

		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Victory and Defeat Conditions",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing victory conditions, defeat conditions, and player notifications.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple logical checks and user feedback mechanisms that should be handled separately for clarity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-Time Mechanics",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration into real-time clock development, shield regeneration, and phaser cooldown management.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating real-time mechanics with turn-based gameplay is complex and requires careful handling of multiple components."
